# Estimating-personality-from-a-facial-photo
Experimental script testing estimation of personality from a facial photo.

In the `images` folder are composite images—faces averaging people high and low in Big Five traits from the [Little & Perrett (2007)](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/000712606X109648) study—against which a facial photo from the `photo` folder is compared.

**Caveat: This script is intended strictly for experimental and educational purposes. It does not provide a valid, reliable, or scientifically endorsed method for inferring personality traits from facial images. Personality is a complex, multi-dimensional construct that cannot be accurately assessed from appearance alone. Any apparent patterns or outputs should be interpreted as illustrative artifacts of the dataset and method—not as diagnostic or predictive insights. Use responsibly and with critical awareness of ethical and scientific limitations.**
